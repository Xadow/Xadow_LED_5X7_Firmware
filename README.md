Xadow_LED_5X7_Firmware
======================

Drop all folders into your arduino libraries directory. Use the testFunction sketch to test all the features of the led matrix.

If something happens the firmware for the matrix is also included. The matrix is just an arduino. Load the firmware sketch and program it fresh. It comes programmed from the factory so you shouldn't need to do this unless something happens.
